# Citadel Auth — Development Guide

## Project Overview

Citadel Auth is a privacy-first 2FA authenticator built with Flutter. It generates TOTP/HOTP codes and stores all secrets locally in an encrypted SQLite database.

## Development Commands

Always use the `./dev.sh` helper script instead of running Flutter directly:

```bash
./dev.sh start   # Launch emulator + run app
./dev.sh get     # pub get
./dev.sh build   # build_runner code generation
./dev.sh test    # Run tests
./dev.sh clean   # Clean + re-get
```

The project uses FVM — all Flutter commands go through `fvm flutter`.

## Architecture

- **State management:** Riverpod (with riverpod_generator for codegen)
- **Database:** SQLCipher (encrypted SQLite), schema version 2
- **Encryption:** Argon2id key derivation → AES-256-GCM
- **Platform services:** `local_auth` for biometrics, `flutter_secure_storage` for keystore

### Key directories

- `lib/core/` — Models, providers, and crypto (OTP engine, vault encryption, import/export)
- `lib/data/` — Database layer and repositories
- `lib/platform/` — Platform service wrappers (biometrics, keystore)
- `lib/ui/` — Screens, widgets, and theme

### State flow

The app uses a vault state machine: `Uninitialized → Locked → Unlocked`. The `vaultProvider` in `lib/core/providers.dart` is the central state holder. Tokens are filtered by the active profile via `tokenListProvider`.

## Code Style

- Dart with Flutter lints (`flutter_lints`)
- Models use `json_serializable` — run `./dev.sh build` after changing model classes
- Riverpod providers use annotations (`@riverpod`) — also requires build_runner

## Important Patterns

- Token secrets are always encrypted at rest — never log or print them
- All database operations go through repository classes in `lib/data/repositories/`
- OTP code generation is in `lib/core/crypto/otp_engine.dart` — RFC 6238 (TOTP) and RFC 4226 (HOTP)
- Import/export supports multiple formats (Citadel, Aegis, 2FAS, Ente Auth) in `lib/core/crypto/import_export.dart`
- Profiles have color coding and sort order; groups organize tokens within profiles
- Auto-lock triggers on `AppLifecycleState.paused` with configurable timeout

## Testing

```bash
./dev.sh test
```

## Common Tasks

- **Add a new screen:** Create in `lib/ui/screens/`, add route in `main.dart`
- **Add a provider:** Add to `lib/core/providers.dart` with `@riverpod` annotation, then run `./dev.sh build`
- **Modify models:** Edit in `lib/core/models/`, run `./dev.sh build` for JSON serialization
- **Database schema change:** Update `lib/data/database/vault_database.dart`, increment version, add migration
